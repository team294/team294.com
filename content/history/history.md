  title: History
  body: >-
    Beach Cities Robotics has been a participant in FIRST Robotics Competition
    since 1996, when Hope Chapel Academy, Hawthorne High School, Mira Costa High
    School (MCHS), and Redondo Union High School (RUHS) joined to form Team 61
    “Circuit Breakers” as one of the first two teams in Southern California. In
    1998, Hope Chapel formed Team 330 “Beach Bots,” while Hawthorne, RUHS, and
    MCHS stayed together and were known as “Vultures”. In 1999, Hawthorne formed
    Team 207 “Metal Crafters” while RUHS and MCHS became Team 294, today known
    as “Beach Cities Robotics.” Since then, Team 294 has won two world
    championships, twelve blue banners, and many other awards at competitions.
    Most importantly, we have continued to inspire and challenge students ever
    since our founding.
