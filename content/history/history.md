  title: History
  body: Beach Cities Robotics has been a participant in FIRST Robotics Competition since 1996, when Hope Chapel Academy, Hawthorne High School, Mira Costa High School (MCHS), and Redondo Union High School (RUHS) joined to form Team 61 “Circuit Breakers” as one of the first two teams in Southern California. In 1998, Hope Chapel formed Team 330 “Beach Bots,” while Hawthorne, RUHS, and MCHS stayed together and were known as “Vultures”. In 1999, Hawthorne formed Team 207 “Metal Crafters” while RUHS and MCHS became Team 294, today known as “Beach Cities Robotics.” Since then, Team 294 has won two world championships, ten blue banners, and many other awards at competitions. Most importantly, we have continued to inspire and challenge students ever since our founding.
