      Beach Cities Robotics is proud to present our brand new website! The recent rebranding efforts have been a focus for the business team to give our team imagery a well-needed fresh look. The website itself was a summer project for the programming students, using JavaScript, React, Next, Tailwind, and TinaCMS with GitHub Actions deployment to Cloudflare. While we are still adding content to the site, feel free to poke around and explore what we have so far!
