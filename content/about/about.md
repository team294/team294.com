  body: "FIRST -- “For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology” -- is a global non-profit founded by Dean Kamen in 1989. FIRST supports 3.2 million youth aged from Pre-K to 12th Grade through their various robotics programs. The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is what Beach Cities Robotics is a part of, which is for high school students. Touted as the ultimate Sport for the\_Mind, FRC participants can learn skills in design, fabrication, programming, electrical engineering, and business."

        The mechanical sub-team at Beach Cities Robotics is responsible for the
        design, fabrication, and assembly of our robots. We begin by drafting
        multiple concepts using CAD software to develop effective designs and
        refining 3D models for optimal performance. Once finalized, detailed
        drawings guide in-house manufacturing, maintaining our teams quality
        control. Our workshop is equipped with CNC machines, laser cutters, and
        other advanced machinery, ensuring high accuracy. After fabrication, our
        team assembles the components using materials like screws and rivets,
        based on the CAD models. The mechanical sub-team’s dedication to
        creativity, precision, and collaboration brings our robotic creations to
        life.

        The Programming Sub-Team at Beach Cities Robotics handles all coding
        tasks, ensuring efficient coordination with other sub-teams. We use data
        from motors and gyroscopes to navigate precisely and enhance  accuracy.
        We work with the design team to program new features and with the drive
        team to design control layouts and LED signaling. For the autonomous
        period, we collaborate with the strategy team to program routes for
        optimal scoring. During driver control, we develop command sequences for
        complex actions. We also use computer vision and trajectory calculations
        to improve task accuracy. Additionally, we ensure all software systems
        are functional and up to date, test gyro and motor systems, and maintain
        the team website.

        The Electrical Sub-Team at Beach Cities Robotics handles tasks that
        blend mechanical and programming work. We swap gearboxes, wire circuit
        boards, and solder USB-C cables. Our main focus is wiring the
        competition robot, starting with CAD in Onshape to plan the electronics
        layout. After ranking designs for efficiency, we update components,
        check for damage, and place them on the robot’s belly pan before wiring
        everything. Electrical work is like the robot’s cardiovascular system,
        enabling signal transmission for various tasks. Our members learn wiring
        basics, soldering, multimeter skills, CAD, and circuit fundamentals. The
        variety of projects merging mechanical and programming concepts makes
        electrical work captivating.

        The Strategy Sub-Team at Beach Cities Robotics collaborates with the
        mechanical and programming sub-teams to ensure our robot is
        strategically designed. At kickoff, we analyze the new game, inspired by
        Karthik Kanagasabapathy’s Effective First Strategies, to find the best
        ways to score points. We create priority lists and design requirements
        for both mechanical and programming teams. After game analysis, we
        predict match strategies and iterate our custom scouting app to collect
        accurate, user-friendly data. This information guides our pre-match
        strategy meetings and alliance selections. We believe strong Strategic
        Design, Scouting, and Match Strategy are key to success.

        The Impact Sub-Team at Beach Cities Robotics engages local communities
        and raises awareness about our organization and FIRST Robotics. We focus
        on involving kids in STEM activities to prepare them for the future. Our
        team attends local events like STEM nights and runs our own events to
        spark community interest. We also handle creative tasks like button
        design and spirit gear. To maintain partnerships, we recognize sponsors
        and find ways to give back. Additionally, we manage award submissions
        for the Impact Award. Currently, we are enhancing community involvement,
        especially through programs for children and the Friendship Foundation.

        The Business Sub-Team at Beach Cities Robotics is dedicated to the
        internal operations that ensure our team's sustainability and success.
        We manage the logistics of each event, overseeing application processes
        and payment deadlines. Our team crafts strategic plans to promote
        long-term stability, including securing sponsorships, budgeting,
        developing educational programs, and recruiting new students. We also
        coordinate outreach event logistics, liaising with vendors and
        collaborating with other teams. In addition, we manage our team's brand,
        ensuring consistency across our Instagram, merchandise, flyers, and
        website. For awards, we focus on submitting the FIRST Woodie Flowers
        Award, which honors outstanding FRC team mentors.
