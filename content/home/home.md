    Beach Cities Robotics (BCR) is a program for high school students to design,
    build, and write software for 120-pound robots. The team is comprised of
    students mostly from Redondo Union High School and Mira Costa High School,
    along with parent volunteers and industry professionals who serve as
    mentors.


    BCR is known as Team 294 in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Each year, the
    team gets a new challenge, creates a unique robot, and takes it to events
    where they compete with teams from all around the world. Students not only
    gain incredible technical skills but also have unique experiences that
    prepare them for their careers and beyond.


    The competition season runs every January to April, with the lab space open
    several days a week. When not actively in-season, the team works on projects
    to strengthen their skills in engineering, science, technology, and
    business. Students also volunteer their time to serve their community and
    spread their love for robotics.
